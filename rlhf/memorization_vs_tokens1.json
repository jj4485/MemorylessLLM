I wanted the player to actually have a chance to control something. So I changed my initial idea to a racing game, but with the same elements as in the original car simulator. A car is controlled by a character, and the car can be damaged, and the character needs to be protected. And the car has to evolve into something better to win.\n\n\n\nI was also curious about the visual style of the game, so I made a design document including the concept art style, and how I wanted the game to look like.\n\n\n\nI had a very hard time picking between the two concepts. They were both so good. In the end, the racing game won.\n\n\n\nFor the final design, I had a few more ideas regarding the visual style. I wanted to make the game look like a retro-futuristic future, with the game characters taking place in a post-apocalyptic world.\n\n\n\nI was also thinking about having an \u201cEvolution Lab\u201d as a central hub for the game, where players can train the car to become stronger, and evolve",
